# On Wax

On wax is a platform for record collectors, enthusiasts and traders to share their collections, meet like minded people, or just find information about those rare or forgotten gems.

This project began life as a simple REST API built with Node, Express and PostgreSQL for tracking my personal vinyl collection but soon grew into a side project that aims to have similar functionality to platforms such as Instagram (minus the horrifying business practices ðŸ˜±).

You can see the original project [here](https://github.com/theoboldalex/on_wax). Or visit [On wax](https://on-wax.herokuapp.com) directly.

## Technical

This project is built with Laravel, Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS, backed by a MySQL database which is hosted on Heroku and makes use of AWS S3 storage.
