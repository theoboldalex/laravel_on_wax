# On Wax

On wax is a platform for record collectors, enthusiasts and traders to share their collections, meet like minded people, or just find information about those rare or forgotten gems.

This project began life as a simple REST API built with Node, Express and PostgreSQL for tracking my personal vinyl collection but soon grew into a side project that aims to have similar functionality to platforms such as Instagram (minus the horrifying business practices 😱).

## Technical

This project is built with Laravel, Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS, backed by a MySQL database which is hosted on Heroku and makes use of AWS S3 storage.
